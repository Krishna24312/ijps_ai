1,Hair Cosmetics for the Hair Loss Patient,"Maria Fernanda Reis Gavazzoni Dias,Aline Falci Loures,Chloe Ekelem","Medical professionals that treat patients with alopecia usually lack knowledge about hair cosmetics. Trichologists focus on hair cycling and growth problems and not on the hair shaft integrity. This may lead to abandon of the use of the prescribed treatment, such as topical minoxidil or to inadequate traumatic grooming habits that may jeopardize hair follicle health. Shampoos, hair dyes, and hair-straightening products may alter hair fiber structure, remove lipids, and elude protein. Hair procedures such as hair dying and straightening have side effects and health concerns, especially for pregnant women or sensitive hair and scalp patients. Hair breakage, follicle traction, frizz, contact dermatitis, and mutagenicity are possible side effects of hair cosmetics misuse. The proper use of hair care products may help to increase patients' adherence to alopecia treatments and avoid health problems related to inadequate application of hair cosmetics and procedures.",hair care - hair cosmetics - shampoo - conditioner - hair dyes - hair straightening - hair transplant,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1739241,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1739241.pdf
2,Manual lymphatic drainage and therapeutic ultrasound in liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty post-operative period,"Igor F. B Masson,Bruna D. A de Oliveira,Aline Fernanda Perez Machado,Thiago Saikali Farcic,Ivaldo Esteves Júnior,Cristiano Schiavinato Baldan","Background: Physiotherapy in the plastic surgery post-operative (PO) is essential to provide means for an adequate and fast recovery as it restores function through the use of physiotherapeutic procedures. Aim: The aim of the following study is to verify the effects of the association between the manual lymphatic drainage and the therapeutic ultrasound on pain, oedema and the tissue fibrosis in liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty PO. Design: This is a clinical trial prospective. Materials and Methods: Eighteen women aged between 18 and 60 years participated in this study, in the late PO period following lipoabdominoplasty or liposuction in the abdomen, flanks and lower trunk, which showed tissue fibrosis of the flanks and abdomen regions. They were divided into two groups: Liposuction group and lipoabdominoplasty group. A total of twelve sessions of therapeutic ultrasound followed by the manual lymphatic drainage were performed. The patients were assessed with regard to pain, oedema and tissue fibrosis in different moments: Initial assessment, during assessment and final assessment through the application of the protocol of evaluation of cysts fibrosis levels. Statistical Analysis: The test of equality for two proportions and the confidence interval test for mean to evaluate the distribution of variables. The significance level adopted for statistical tests was 5% (P < 0.05). Results: There was a statistically significant reduction of pain, swelling and tissue fibrosis in both groups. Conclusion: the association between manual lymphatic drainage and the therapeutic ultrasound reduced the swelling and the tissue fibrosis and made pain disappear in liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty PO period.",Oedema - lipectomy - lymphatic system - plastic - surgery - ultrasound therapy,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.4103/0970-0358.129627,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.4103/0970-0358.129627.pdf
3,Complications of Hair Transplant Procedures—Causes and Management,"Anil Kumar Garg,Seema Garg","Hair transplant surgery per se has low risk, is relatively safe, and has minimum incidence of complications. However, it is a well-accepted fact that no medical science procedure exists without any potential risk of complications. The complication may be a single complaint in the form of pain, itching, dissatisfaction related to the procedure's outcome, or surgical complication in the form of infection, wound dehiscence or skin necrosis. Inadequate counselling increases unsatisfaction. Improper examination increases the complications, and incomplete medical history and history of allergy increases the risk during surgery.

The author collected data of his 2896 patients, operated over a period of 10 years, and recorded the complains and complications. The most common complications were sterile folliculitis, noted in 203 patients, vasovagal shock in seven patients of, hypertensive crisis in one patient, hiccups in six patients, facial edema after hair transplant in 18 patients, graft dislodgement in 8 patients, infection in two diabetic patients, minor necrotic patches in recipient area in three patients, keloid development in one patient, numbness in 18 cases, and hypersensitivity in recipient and/or donor area. Donor area effluvium was seen in one case and three patients showed recipient area effluvium. Twenty-six patients were not happy with the results, and five cases showed partial loss of implanted hair. The overall significant life-threatening or major complications were zero, but the total minor complications' percentage was 0.10%.

The key to minimize complaints and complications are detailed counselling, taking careful medical history and history of allergy, and proper examination of patients.",wound dehiscence - necrosis - scalp laxity - telogen effluvium - hypertensive crisis,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1739255,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1739255.pdf
4,Pharmacological Management of Pattern Hair Loss,"Sandeep Suresh Sattur
Indu Sandeep Sattur","Pattern hair loss (PHL) is a condition that worsens with time and the only way it can be slowed down is with pharmacological intervention. Pharmacological treatments for PHL, from an evidenced-based perspective with respect to safety and efficacy, are limited to only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride. However, there are a host of drugs being used, off-label with limited evidence. This article attempts to review the literature on this topic, and the authors add to this, with their experience of over two decades on incorporating pharmacologic treatments along with hair transplantation in their management of PHL.",Pattern Hair Loss - Minoxidil - Finasteride - Post finasteride syndrome - Dutasteride - Topical finasteride,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1739254,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1739254.pdf
5,Pressure ulcers: Current understanding and newer modalities of treatment,"Surajit Bhattacharya
R. K. Mishra","This article reviews the mechanism, symptoms, causes, severity, diagnosis, prevention and present recommendations for surgical as well as non-surgical management of pressure ulcers. Particular focus has been placed on the current understandings and the newer modalities for the treatment of pressure ulcers. The paper also covers the role of nutrition and pressure-release devices such as cushions and mattresses as a part of the treatment algorithm for preventing and quick healing process of these wounds. Pressure ulcers develop primarily from pressure and shear; are progressive in nature and most frequently found in bedridden, chair bound or immobile people. They often develop in people who have been hospitalised for a long time generally for a different problem and increase the overall time as well as cost of hospitalisation that have detrimental effects on patient’s quality of life. Loss of sensation compounds the problem manifold, and failure of reactive hyperaemia cycle of the pressure prone area remains the most important aetiopathology. Pressure ulcers are largely preventable in nature, and their management depends on their severity. The available literature about severity of pressure ulcers, their classification and medical care protocols have been described in this paper. The present treatment options include various approaches of cleaning the wound, debridement, optimised dressings, role of antibiotics and reconstructive surgery. The newer treatment options such as negative pressure wound therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, cell therapy have been discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of current and newer methods have also been described.",Bedsore - decubitus ulcer - pressure sore - pressure ulcer,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.4103/0970-0358.155260,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.4103/0970-0358.155260.pdf
6,Effects of Caffeine Consumption on Autologous Full-Thickness Skin Graft Healing in an Animal Model,"Tommy Supit

Najatullah","Background There exists contradictory evidence that states both the beneficial
and deleterious effects of caffeine on wound healing. The general population might
unknowingly consume caffeine that negatively affects wound healing. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of daily caffeine consumption on wound
healing, specifically full-thickness skin graft (FTSG).
Methods Forty Sprague–Dawley rats were randomized into four groups of equal
size: control-dose (CD), low-dose (LD), medium-dose (MD), and high-dose (HD) caffeine groups. After autologous FTSG, all subjects in the intervention group were given
daily pure caffeine gavage. The FTSG was explanted 7 days posttransplant. The graft
viability, secondary contraction, and adherence were evaluated macroscopically, while
fibroblast and collagen deposition was analyzed microscopically with hematoxylin
eosin stain.
Results The least graft viability (72.8 ± 20.7%, clinical wound assessment scale
[CWAS] 2.4), highest secondary contraction (11.4 ± 10.5%), and fibroblast count
(331.8 ± 88.6 cells/5 high power fields) were observed in the MD group. More collagen
synthesis was observed in subjects who consumed caffeine. The level of secondary
contraction, fibroblast count as well as graft viability and collagen synthesis were positively correlated.
Conclusions Daily consumption of caffeine impairs graft viability when given in
medium dose and increases collagen synthesis, irrespective of dosage. This study was
in experimental rats; the results are not directly translatable to humans.",caffeine - graft - autologous - full-thickness skin graft - wound - healing,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1734573,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1734573.pdf
