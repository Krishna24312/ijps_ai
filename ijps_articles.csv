1,Hair Cosmetics for the Hair Loss Patient,"Maria Fernanda Reis Gavazzoni Dias,Aline Falci Loures,Chloe Ekelem","Medical professionals that treat patients with alopecia usually lack knowledge about hair cosmetics. Trichologists focus on hair cycling and growth problems and not on the hair shaft integrity. This may lead to abandon of the use of the prescribed treatment, such as topical minoxidil or to inadequate traumatic grooming habits that may jeopardize hair follicle health. Shampoos, hair dyes, and hair-straightening products may alter hair fiber structure, remove lipids, and elude protein. Hair procedures such as hair dying and straightening have side effects and health concerns, especially for pregnant women or sensitive hair and scalp patients. Hair breakage, follicle traction, frizz, contact dermatitis, and mutagenicity are possible side effects of hair cosmetics misuse. The proper use of hair care products may help to increase patients' adherence to alopecia treatments and avoid health problems related to inadequate application of hair cosmetics and procedures.",hair care - hair cosmetics - shampoo - conditioner - hair dyes - hair straightening - hair transplant,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1739241,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1739241.pdf,
2,Manual lymphatic drainage and therapeutic ultrasound in liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty post-operative period,"Igor F. B Masson,Bruna D. A de Oliveira,Aline Fernanda Perez Machado,Thiago Saikali Farcic,Ivaldo Esteves Júnior,Cristiano Schiavinato Baldan","Background: Physiotherapy in the plastic surgery post-operative (PO) is essential to provide means for an adequate and fast recovery as it restores function through the use of physiotherapeutic procedures. Aim: The aim of the following study is to verify the effects of the association between the manual lymphatic drainage and the therapeutic ultrasound on pain, oedema and the tissue fibrosis in liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty PO. Design: This is a clinical trial prospective. Materials and Methods: Eighteen women aged between 18 and 60 years participated in this study, in the late PO period following lipoabdominoplasty or liposuction in the abdomen, flanks and lower trunk, which showed tissue fibrosis of the flanks and abdomen regions. They were divided into two groups: Liposuction group and lipoabdominoplasty group. A total of twelve sessions of therapeutic ultrasound followed by the manual lymphatic drainage were performed. The patients were assessed with regard to pain, oedema and tissue fibrosis in different moments: Initial assessment, during assessment and final assessment through the application of the protocol of evaluation of cysts fibrosis levels. Statistical Analysis: The test of equality for two proportions and the confidence interval test for mean to evaluate the distribution of variables. The significance level adopted for statistical tests was 5% (P < 0.05). Results: There was a statistically significant reduction of pain, swelling and tissue fibrosis in both groups. Conclusion: the association between manual lymphatic drainage and the therapeutic ultrasound reduced the swelling and the tissue fibrosis and made pain disappear in liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty PO period.",Oedema - lipectomy - lymphatic system - plastic - surgery - ultrasound therapy,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.4103/0970-0358.129627,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.4103/0970-0358.129627.pdf,
3,Complications of Hair Transplant Procedures—Causes and Management,"Anil Kumar Garg,Seema Garg","Hair transplant surgery per se has low risk, is relatively safe, and has minimum incidence of complications. However, it is a well-accepted fact that no medical science procedure exists without any potential risk of complications. The complication may be a single complaint in the form of pain, itching, dissatisfaction related to the procedure's outcome, or surgical complication in the form of infection, wound dehiscence or skin necrosis. Inadequate counselling increases unsatisfaction. Improper examination increases the complications, and incomplete medical history and history of allergy increases the risk during surgery.

The author collected data of his 2896 patients, operated over a period of 10 years, and recorded the complains and complications. The most common complications were sterile folliculitis, noted in 203 patients, vasovagal shock in seven patients of, hypertensive crisis in one patient, hiccups in six patients, facial edema after hair transplant in 18 patients, graft dislodgement in 8 patients, infection in two diabetic patients, minor necrotic patches in recipient area in three patients, keloid development in one patient, numbness in 18 cases, and hypersensitivity in recipient and/or donor area. Donor area effluvium was seen in one case and three patients showed recipient area effluvium. Twenty-six patients were not happy with the results, and five cases showed partial loss of implanted hair. The overall significant life-threatening or major complications were zero, but the total minor complications' percentage was 0.10%.

The key to minimize complaints and complications are detailed counselling, taking careful medical history and history of allergy, and proper examination of patients.",wound dehiscence - necrosis - scalp laxity - telogen effluvium - hypertensive crisis,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1739255,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1739255.pdf,

Indu Sandeep Sattur","Pattern hair loss (PHL) is a condition that worsens with time and the only way it can be slowed down is with pharmacological intervention. Pharmacological treatments for PHL, from an evidenced-based perspective with respect to safety and efficacy, are limited to only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride. However, there are a host of drugs being used, off-label with limited evidence.

5,Pressure ulcers: Current understanding and newer modalities of treatment,"Surajit Bhattacharya
R. K. Mishra","This article reviews the mechanism, symptoms, causes, severity, diagnosis, prevention and present recommendations for surgical as well as non-surgical management of pressure ulcers. Particular focus has been placed on the current understandings and the newer modalities for the treatment of pressure ulcers. The paper also covers the role of nutrition and pressure-release devices such as cushions and mattresses as a part of the treatment algorithm for preventing and quick healing process of these wounds. Pressure ulcers develop primarily from pressure and shear; are progressive in nature and most frequently found in bedridden, chair bound or immobile people. They often develop in people who have been hospitalised for a long time generally for a different problem and increase the overall time as well as cost of hospitalisation that have detrimental effects on patient’s quality of life. Loss of sensation compounds the problem manifold, and failure of reactive hyperaemia cycle of the pressure prone area remains the most important aetiopathology. Pressure ulcers are largely preventable in nature, and their management depends on their severity. The available literature about severity of pressure ulcers, their classification and medical care protocols have been described in this paper. The present treatment options include various approaches of cleaning the wound, debridement, optimised dressings, role of antibiotics and reconstructive surgery. The newer treatment options such as negative pressure wound therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, cell therapy have been discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of current and newer methods have also been described.",Bedsore - decubitus ulcer - pressure sore - pressure ulcer,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.4103/0970-0358.155260,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.4103/0970-0358.155260.pdf,
6,Effects of Caffeine Consumption on Autologous Full-Thickness Skin Graft Healing in an Animal Model,"Tommy Supit

Najatullah","Background There exists contradictory evidence that states both the beneficial
and deleterious effects of caffeine on wound healing. The general population might
unknowingly consume caffeine that negatively affects wound healing. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of daily caffeine consumption on wound
healing, specifically full-thickness skin graft (FTSG).
Methods Forty Sprague–Dawley rats were randomized into four groups of equal
size: control-dose (CD), low-dose (LD), medium-dose (MD), and high-dose (HD) caffeine groups. After autologous FTSG, all subjects in the intervention group were given
daily pure caffeine gavage. The FTSG was explanted 7 days posttransplant. The graft
viability, secondary contraction, and adherence were evaluated macroscopically, while
fibroblast and collagen deposition was analyzed microscopically with hematoxylin
eosin stain.
Results The least graft viability (72.8 ± 20.7%, clinical wound assessment scale
[CWAS] 2.4), highest secondary contraction (11.4 ± 10.5%), and fibroblast count
(331.8 ± 88.6 cells/5 high power fields) were observed in the MD group. More collagen
synthesis was observed in subjects who consumed caffeine. The level of secondary
contraction, fibroblast count as well as graft viability and collagen synthesis were positively correlated.
Conclusions Daily consumption of caffeine impairs graft viability when given in
medium dose and increases collagen synthesis, irrespective of dosage. This study was
in experimental rats; the results are not directly translatable to humans.",caffeine - graft - autologous - full-thickness skin graft - wound - healing,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0041-1734573,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1734573.pdf,
7,Orthoplastic Surgery: A Shining Example for ‘Collaborate and Flourish’ in Multidisciplinary Care,Hari Venkatramani,"For centuries, “Life before limb,” has been the guiding principle in trauma care. Even during the Second World War, a major open fracture with skin and soft tissue loss was considered a life-threatening condition, because the perceived risks to life were enormous and the chances of limb salvage was small. Infection was the main cause of morbidity and mortality, and the inability to cover major gaps in tissues was the cause for the low success rates of limb salvage. The advent of microsurgery made it possible to cover large gaps in both soft tissues and bone. At about the same time, encouraged by the newfound capability of covering large soft tissue gaps, surgeons performed radical debridement. Infection rates dropped, and a new chapter in trauma reconstructive surgery was thus born.

Besides techniques, what really caused the dramatic improvement was the synergistic alliance between plastic and orthopaedic surgeons, which was aimed at optimizing outcomes in limb reconstruction and this discipline was called “orthoplastic surgery.”[1] Bratton and Tumin once proposed the stark dictum “collaborate or perish,” but in modern practice this has evolved into a more optimistic adage: “collaborate and flourish.”[2] Credit for this alliance must be given to institutions like the Kleinert Institute in Louisville, United States, where surgeons from orthopaedic, plastic, and general surgical backgrounds all worked together. Each did what they could do best, and everyone sought the help of the other if needed, and ultimately, the patient had good outcomes. Some names who have to be honored are Marko Godina, a Slovenian surgeon who was a fellow in Louisville in 1978. He went back to his war-ravaged country and had an opportunity to introduce the early soft tissue cover for open fractures. A few years later, he came back to Louisville and presented his enormous experience. The Kleinert team encouraged him to write it up. He stayed for a few weeks and wrote the draft. Unfortunately, on return he was killed in a tragic road traffic accident in 1986 at the age of 43. Lister and Kleinert took the responsibility of translating his work from Slovenian to English and wrote up a limited edition called “The Thesis.”[3]

Godina stressed that the cause for the poor outcome was the artificial separation of the two specialties, orthopaedic and plastic surgery, which made them see the patient sequentially and not together. The system of orthopaedic and plastic surgeons, simultaneously seeing the patient, gradually became the recommended standard of care. Scott Levin, who was a fellow in Louisville in 1986, is credited for coining the term “orthoplastic surgery.”

Recently, an international journal has been started called “Orthoplastic Surgery” to promote advances in this discipline. An International Congress for Orthoplastic Surgeons is going to be held in New York from May 14 to 16, 2026.[4]","orthoplastic surgery

Magistra C. Margaretha","ackground The application of stem cells in plastic, reconstructive, and aesthetic
surgery has emerged as a promising frontier in anti-aging medicine. Stem cells,
particularly adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
are increasingly utilized for their regenerative properties, offering innovative solutions
for a range of aesthetic and reconstructive challenges.
Objective This review explores the current and potential clinical applications of stem
cells in plastic surgery, focusing on their role in grafting, facial rejuvenation, wound
healing, soft tissue reconstruction, and hair restoration.
Materials and Methods A comprehensive literature analysis was conducted using the
PRISMA algorithm, examining studies and clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy,
safety, and outcomes of stem cell-based therapies in plastic surgery. Emphasis was
placed on the therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells, including their ability to enhance
tissue regeneration, reduce scarring, and improve graft survival.
Results Out of the 5,117 studies identified, 22 met the inclusion criteria, highlighting
the diverse applications of stem cells in plastic surgery. These studies reported
significant advancements in aesthetic and reconstructive outcomes.
Conclusion Stem cell therapies represent a transformative approach in plastic
surgery, offering significant benefits in aesthetic enhancement and functional restora-
tion. While current applications show promising results, ongoing research is essential
to address regulatory issues, ethical considerations, and the need for standardized
treatment protocols.

This study compares patient satisfaction and quality of life after female-to-male gender confirmation surgery using an anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap and radial forearm free flap (RFFF).

Materials and Methods This study included 49 patients who underwent phalloplasty from 2014 to 2019 using two different methods. The two groups' outcomes and quality of life were investigated and compared 1 year after the operation.

Results The mean age of the patients in this study was 32.7 years. Among patients, 44.9% underwent revision operations, and 38.8% had residual protective sensations after 1 year. In terms of quality of life after surgery, the general shape of the phallus, cold and heat sensation, sense of touch, the body of glans and shaft, color and size of the phallus, sexual pleasure in patients and their partners, and the relationship between the number of anastomosed nerves and sexual satisfaction, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The ALT group had statistically significantly higher rates of orgasms compared to the RFFF group.

11,"The Treatment of Facial Asymmetry with Botulinum Toxin: Current Concepts, Guidelines, and Future Trends",Izolda Heydenrych,"This article will describe facial asymmetry secondary to facial nerve paralysis (FNP), and review current concepts, guidelines, and future trends. Despite the increasing use of botulinum toxin (BoNTA) in treating FNP, ideal dosage, timing, and additional therapies are not unequivocally established. Facial asymmetry significantly impacts quality of life (QOL) by strongly affecting self-perception and social interactions; injectables may mediate great clinical improvement. This article provides practical guidelines for the use of BoNTA and provides schemes for accurate assessment and documentation. A systematic, stepwise approach is recommended with methodical assessment, meticulous placement, conservative dosage, and careful follow-up. Future trends include the potential use of newly developed toxins, muscle modification with fillers, improved imaging techniques, and targeted QOL studies.
